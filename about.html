                    <h2>My Past</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Andrew Kerr and I'm here to tell you all about how I'm the best software developer you've ever seen and how I got here!<br /><br />

                        I was born in March 1993, Raleigh North Carolina. When I was a child, as young as 4 years old I started to wonder about my mother's personal computer. 
                        I learned how to log in (without her knowing of course) how to type and browse the internet, and most importantly how to play games. After a while though I wanted more.<br /><br />
                        
                        When I became a young teenager I became obsessed with learning how computers worked. Not exactly how computers worked, but how the programs we used worked, that was far more interesting to me.
                        I began with learning the basics of html, back when html4 was still in the making. Back then I wasn't exactly a savant in writing dynamic webpages, but it's what started my journey.<br /><br />

                        After html, I started teaching myself javascript, trying to figure out how to manage all the little concepts and intricacies of basic programming.
                        Not long after, I yearned for more. I started learning java, going so far as to rent books from libraries (getting me to read a book back then was an accomplishment in its own)!
                        Then I started trying to learn C, then C++, and then came my most enjoyed and my now most experienced language C#.<br /><br />

                        I ended up attending Wake Tech Community College in Cary NC for an associates in computer programming. I had to leave however because of a family member's bad health, and not finishing my degree.
                        Years later, an opportunity came up, my family was in good health and it was time. I moved to Bremerton WA this year to attend Olympic College.
